# The AI Everywhere Vision

Welcome to the **Chrome Built-in AI Workshop**!

We are entering a new era where users expect intelligence to be woven into every digital interaction. Whether it's summarizing a long article, proofreading an email, or translating a foreign phrase, these tasks shouldn't require copy-pasting text into a separate chatbot or paying for expensive cloud subscriptions.

## The Problem: Friction

Currently, adding AI to workflows often involves:
*   **Context Switching**: Leaving the current tab to visit an AI tool.
*   **Privacy Concerns**: Sending sensitive user data to a remote server.
*   **Latency**: Waiting for network round-trips.
*   **Cost**: Paying for API tokens or subscriptions.

## The Solution: Built-in AI with Gemini Nano

Modern browsers are becoming AI powerhouses. With Chrome's **Built-in AI**, we can bring the magic of Large Language Models (LLMs) directly to the user's device using **Gemini Nano**.

### Why Local First?
- **Zero Cost**: Runs entirely on the user's hardware (GPU/NPU). No API keys, no per-token fees.
- **Privacy by Design**: Data never leaves the device. Process sensitive info with confidence.
- **Instant Latency**: No network delays. The model is right there in the browser.
- **Offline Capable**: Works purely offline, perfect for travel or unstable connections.

## What We Will Build

In this workshop, you will build **"AI Power Tools"**, a Chrome Extension that brings this vision to life. It will help users:
1.  **Write & Rewrite**: Refine text directly in any input field.
2.  **Translate**: Instantly translate selected text.
3.  **Detect Language**: Identify languages on the fly.

Everything will happen locally, leveraging the specialized tasks of the Prompt API and Explorer APIs. We will also briefly touch on **Polyfills** to support other browsers.

Let's make AI accessible, private, and ubiquitous. Let's bring the magic to the user.
