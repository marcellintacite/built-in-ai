# Chrome Built-in AI Workshop

Welcome to the future of the web.

In this workshop, we will explore how to bring **Privacy-First, Offline-Capable AI** to your users using Chrome's Built-in AI APIs (Gemini Nano).

## Workshop Modules

### 1. [The AI Everywhere Vision](intro.md)
Understand why the browser is the best place for AI, and why local models (Gemini Nano) are a game changer for cost, latency, and privacy.

### 2. [Environment Setup](environment-setup.md)
**CRITICAL**: Prepare your browser and hardware (Flags, Localhost, Specs) to run local AI models.

### 3. [Core Concepts: Built-in AI](built-in-ai.md)
Learn about the **Prompt API** and the new **Specialist APIs** (Writer, Rewriter, Translator) that drive our application.

### 3. [Build Guide: "AI Power Tools" Extension](extension-guide.md)
Get your hands dirty! We will build a production-ready Chrome Extension featuring:
- **Smart Rewrite Button**: Injected into any web page.
- **Context Menu Tools**: Translation at a right-click.
- **Side Panel Assistant**: A full chat interface.

### 4. [Cross-Browser Support (Polyfill)](polyfill.md)
Learn how to bring these APIs to Firefox, Safari, and other browsers using the **Language Model Polyfill**.
